# Active Context: Weekly Budget Tracker

## Current Focus

- Implementing core UI components for transaction input
- Developing data visualization for spending analysis
- Finalizing IndexedDB integration

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced TransactionInput with date field, validation, and error handling
- Established core services (IDB, Categories, Money)
- Created utility modules (currency, date formatting)
- Documented project architecture and patterns
- Established comment standards for all code documents

## Key Decisions

- Using IndexedDB for client-side persistence
- Material-UI for consistent styling
- Functional components with TypeScript
- Weekly/monthly views as separate components

## Implementation Patterns

- Services pattern for business logic
- Custom hooks for reusable functionality
- Context API for shared state

## Next Steps

1. Create weekly/monthly breakdown views
2. Connect UI to services
3. Implement data persistence flow
4. Test offline functionality
